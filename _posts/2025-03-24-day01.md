Yeah, it does have to be more than one thing at a time. I suppose the blog/portfolio website will have to stay like this for awhile. I'm really glad to be dusting off the cobwebs of my C programming skills with Hackerrank (while building the website), but it still pains me that I'm as rusty as I am in the first place. Not much I can do other than keep juggling my time, making steady progress on multiple ongoing projects simultaneously. That and continuing to apply to jobs, of course! Yay...

Pretty excited to make another laser etched prototype of my brother's stamp on draftboard tomorrow. The soapstone will have to wait. So will the programming the custom scrolling quotes LED matrix, coloring in more of the base colors of my friend's comic, reading the rules in Call of Cthulhu, growing seedlings of Thai basil and chives. I hope to start posting work in progress (WIP) photos and videos of all my "professional" and "non-professional" pursuits here too. Could be a cool recording of how I'm spending my life, I guess.

Got the vehicle tabs renewed and my taxes done, so that's a relief. Still need to get my enhanced id. Maybe this weekend we'll get around to finally donating stuff that's been here since we moved in! More importantly looking forward to playing Cyberpunk RED character creation and session 0, along with continuing our Odyssey of the Dragonlords D&D 5e campaign. Always feels like there's never enough time for everything.
